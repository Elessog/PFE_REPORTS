Check marine environment more easily , need sailboat that can stay in the sea without surveillance 
and also moving to different part of the sea or ocean. One of the way of gathering data is with cable of 
hydrophones to detect porpoises, an endangered species in the Baltic sea. the advantage of the sailboat would be the manoeuvrability without the noise of a manned boat and the possibility to go in more close to land water, and area not covered by the buoy.\\

The goal of this report is to determine the viability of a simulator to help
the modelling of a sailboat towing a cable. The modelling of a cable can be done
with different ways such as finite elements for the more complicated solutions or by assimilating the cable
as multiple connected rods. The last method as been chosen for the model with two options. First using 
a multi-body engine such as SimMechanics\texttrademark~ in Matlab$^{\circledR}$, then by implementing a language free algorithm to simulate
only a rod cable model~\cite{johansen2007modelling} (the goal was to not be dependent on a particular external software).\\
The cable simulation will be then added to the modified sailboat model to take into account the effect of
the cable on the sailboat.
