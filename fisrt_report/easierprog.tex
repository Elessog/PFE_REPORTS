The first design of the code was too complicated and old to be able to simply implement the simulation in
the code itself, therefore the easiest way to do it was to pre-empt the connection to the sensor;

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\psscalebox{0.5 0.5} % Change this value to rescale the drawing.
{
\input{model_com}
}
\caption{Model of the boat.}
\label{fig:model_boat_}
\end{figure}

The data comes, from and to the main program regulating the boat via three different mean.
The sensor data comes from serial ports \gls{RS232} and \gls{i2c} communication \gls{GPS}
