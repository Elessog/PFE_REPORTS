To test the model, a cable with a pressure sensor has been put on the boat in order to capture the behaviour
of the cable.

The boat is a retrofitted one person sailing boat . 
First the gathered data will be compared with the old model for tuning. Then the test with cable will be compared to the new model.
Cant expect perfect result because the model of sailboat is not perfect, it only allow to design controller for the boat itself. The goal is the same here determine possibility for controller create a new model for cable (from profile determine from the cable is it doesn't effect to much the boat)
Tests has been realised to test the boat:

\begin{itemize}
\item Cable added on the hull of the boat (between 6 and 20 m)
\item Tapping a pressure sensor on the cable
\item Boat has to reach multiple waypoints while measuring the depth of the pressure sensor
\item Boat redo the same path without cable
\end{itemize}

To measure the depth of the cable a pressure sensor is put alongside it, the pressure sensor cable is smaller than 
the long one (3 meters in the water) so to compare to the simulation what is compare is the depth of the 3 meter mark on the boat or the depth of the end of the cable compared to the pressure sensor extrapolated to the length of the bigger cable.

\subsection{Validation of cable simulation}

First the depth of the pressure sensor will be compared to the depth of the simulation of the cable when taking the speed and position data.
